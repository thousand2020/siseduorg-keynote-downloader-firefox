## 🤔 Why This Project?

sisedu.org provides **no way to download keynotes** — there's no download button, no export option, nothing. The only way to get the PDF is to dig through the browser's DevTools, find the right network request, and manually copy the URL. This extension eliminates all of that.

- 🚫 **No download button exists** — sisedu.org simply doesn't offer one, leaving you stuck unless you know your way around DevTools
- 📦 **No manual digging** — No need to hunt through network requests or page source for the PDF URL
- ⚡ **One click** — Open the extension, click download, done
- 🔓 **Open source** — See exactly what the extension does and how it works
- 🛠️ **Learning project** — Built to learn ~~Chrome~~ Firefox Extension development with Manifest V3

## 🚀 Installation

Since this extension isn't on the ~~Chrome~~ Firefox Web Store, you'll need to load it manually:

1. **Download or clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thousand2020/siseduorg-keynote-downloader-firefox.git
   ```

2. **Open ~~Chrome~~ Firefox Extensions**  
   Navigate to `firefox://extensions/`

3. **Enable Developer Mode**  
   Toggle **Developer mode** in the top right corner

4. **Load the extension**  
   Click **Load unpacked** and select the cloned folder

5. **Pin it** *(optional)*  
   Click the puzzle icon in ~~Chrome~~ Firefox's toolbar and pin the extension for easy access

---

## 📖 Usage

1. Navigate to a keynote editor on sisedu.org  
   *(URL should match `sisedu.org/classroom/.../editor`)*

2. Click the extension icon in your toolbar

3. Click **⬇ Download Keynote**

4. The PDF will be downloaded automatically with the keynote's name as the filename

> ⚠️ **Note:** The extension only works on sisedu.org keynote editor pages. Opening it elsewhere will show an overlay telling you to navigate there first.

## 🔧 How It Works

### Flow

```
Popup click
    └─► Background service worker
            └─► Injects script.js into the active tab
                    ├─► Fetches keynote metadata (name, UUID) from the page
                    ├─► Constructs the Supabase PDF storage URL
                    ├─► Fetches the PDF blob
                    └─► Triggers a download & reports status back
```

### PDF URL Structure

```
https://supabase.sisedu.org/storage/v1/object/public/coursework/{subject}/{grade}/{uuid}.pdf
```

The UUID and metadata are extracted from the keynote module page by parsing its HTML.

### Status Persistence

Status messages (e.g. `"Fetching PDF..."`, `"Download complete!"`) are saved to `firefox.storage.session` by the background service worker. When you reopen the popup mid-download, it reads the last known status so you're never left wondering what's happening.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### The overlay says "Open a keynote editor on sisedu.org first"
- Make sure you're on a page with a URL matching `sisedu.org/.../editor`
- Try refreshing the page and reopening the extension

### Clicking download does nothing
- Open ~~Chrome~~ Firefox DevTools on the popup (`firefox://extensions/` → **Inspect views: popup**) and check the console for errors
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled and the extension is loaded correctly

### Status is stuck on "Fetching PDF..."
- The PDF URL may have changed — open an issue with the keynote URL pattern you're seeing
